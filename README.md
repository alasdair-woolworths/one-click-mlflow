- Terraform, make, and jq installed

Run `gcloud auth application-default login` if running from a local environment to ensure the deafult login is used

Run `make one-click-mlflow` and let the wizard guide you.

If you want to see the innards, you can run it in debug mode: `DEBUG=true make one-click-mlflow`

### 1.1.4. Other available make commands
- `make deploy`: builds and pushes the application image and (re)deploys the infrastructure
- `make docker`: builds and pushes the application image
- `make apply`: (re)deploys the infrastructure
- `make destroy`: destroys the infrastructure. **Will not delete the OAuth consent screen, and the app engine application**.


### 1.1.5. Pushing your first parameters, logs, artifacts
Once the deployment successful, you can start pushing to your MLFlow instance.

```bash
cd examples
python3 -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python track_experiment.py
```

You can than adapt `examples/track_experiment.py` and `examples/mlflow_config.py` to suit your application's needs.
